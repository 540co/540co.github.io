This repository contains 540's blog and news website, https://news.540.co

### Publishing a blog post

For a guide to how 540 manages blogging, and technical guidelines for getting your blog post into the site, see the **[540 Blogging Guide](_posts/README.md)**.

### Developing the site

This is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) website. Install Jekyll through Rubygems (you may need `sudo`). At the terminal prompt simply run the following command to install Jekyll:

```bash
gem install jekyll
```

Prerequisites: Installing Jekyll is easy and straight-forward, but there are a few requirements youâ€™ll need to make sure your system has before you start.

- Ruby 
- RubyGems
- Linux, Unix, or Mac OS X
- NodeJS

###Local development
Jekyll comes with a built-in development server that will allow you to preview what the generated site will look like in your browser locally.

Clone the branch and `cd` into it.

Run the below command:
```
$ jekyll serve
# => A development server will run at http://localhost:4000/
# Auto-regeneration: enabled.
```
### Deploying the site

Jekyll will automatically build and deploy any commits to the `_posts` folder.

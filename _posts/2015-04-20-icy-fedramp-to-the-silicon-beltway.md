Last week, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter visited Silicon Valley, advocating for a partnership between Pentagon and America’s hub of technology innovation. At Stanford University, Secretary Carter spoke of a “renewed” and “re-wired” partnership in which Pentagon officials think “outside of our five-sided box”. Cart's speech can be found [here](http://www.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=5621).

He spoke extensively about cyber security and the threats posed to our national security from cyber attackers on a daily basis.  The effectiveness of this partnership is critical in ensuring our national defense capabilities remain the best in the world and in putting the most effective tools in the hands of our physical and cyber warfighters.

But beyond the ongoing philosophical differences between Silicon Valley and our National Security infrastructure (such as balancing the desire for privacy against the demands of fighting terrorism in the wake of Edward Snowden, for example), there are some fundamental bureaucratic aspects of Federal cyber-infrastructure that pose some real challenges.

Last week I needed to get a lot smarter about the FedRAMP approval process for cloud infrastructure and solutions.  FedRAMP is the Federal Government’s program for assessing the security capability of cloud solutions and authorizing them for government use.  It’s effectively a centralization and standardization of the processes Federal agencies go through to grant “Authority to Operate (ATO)” to their IT systems. FedRAMP grew from an understanding on the Government’s part that cloud infrastructure and leveraging multi-tenant applications, while critical to an effective IT strategy for the Fed, represented a potential nightmare scenario for the de-centralized cyber-security approval process.  So the FedRAMP program provides a standard process and a central repository for agencies to review and approve use of cloud capabilities within their organizations.

Centralized, standard processes mean more efficiency and a lower barrier to entry for cloud solutions, right?  Yes and no.  Yes there is a clear, understandable, and navigable path to approval.  Unfortunately, that path requires some pretty hefty investments.  You see, another outcome of FedRAMP is the complete shifting of approval costs to the solution developer.  Under the old “ATO” process, software developers and integrators could build the costs associated with developing the required documentation and performing all of the necessary testing into their contracts and effectively get paid for their effort.


FedRAMP, however, requires the solution provider to make that initial investment before they’ve sold anything to the Government.  So as a solution provider, you’re effectively gambling on your ability to drive enough sales to the Federal Government to offset that investment.  If you’re [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2013/05/20/aws-govcloud-us-achieves-fedramp-agency-ato/) or [Microsoft](http://blogs.office.com/2014/11/20/office-365-receives-fedramp-authority-operate-ato-hhs-oig/), that’s a no-brainer.  You are big enough to easily absorb the hundreds of thousands of dollars and months of effort needed for FedRAMP approval, and you know your solutions are ubiquitous across the Government…. just add a few dollars to your license or subscription costs and you’re in the black.  Not surprisingly, the [list of FedRAMP approvals to date](https://www.fedramp.gov/marketplace/compliant-systems/) includes big names like AT&T, CGI Federal, HP, IBM, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Oracle, and VMWare.  There are a few smaller niche players on the list as well, but nearly three years in, FedRAMP is primarily the domain of inside the beltway regulars.

For smaller, innovative startups with good ideas and not a lot of working capital, that’s a real challenge.  Particularly if they operate outside of the beltway and aren’t connected with the Federal IT community.  The dollar signs that accompany FedRAMP certification, along with the mysteries of the Federal procurement process are a real barrier to entry.  And unwillingness by Federal officials to use anything that isn’t on the approved list means that our government is missing out on innovations that could make a real difference.  Ben Balter suggested last year some steps that could improve the situation, but his edited post from last month fixed some broken links, “but the content remains otherwise unchanged.”

#####So what can we do differently? 

Secretary Carter referenced In-Q-Tel as a bridge between the US Government and the startup community through investments.  A similar incubator approach for cloud solutions could provide access to Federal resources (both capital and human) to get these innovative firms over the FedRAMP hump.

Could we also consider creating a "FedRAMP-lite" process that caters to existing providers and their solutions?  Instead of having the solution providers go through and document (or re-document) their security compliance and processes to fit a Federal documentation standard, the Government (or a Government-designated third party assessment organization) comes in on the Government’s nickel to review documentation and processes to give the solution a seal of approval.  This still requires a cultural shift for Government agencies, and as Ben describes in his [blog post](http://ben.balter.com/2014/03/21/want-to-innovate-in-government-focus-on-culture/#never-take-no-from-someone-who-cant-say-yes) it needs Government officials who are empowered to say “yes”. 

As citizens and innovators, we must demand improvements that will de-ice the Federal on-ramp.

Today's discussion revolved around some of the nuggets from the July Edition of the DC API Meetup (link below) including OpenFEC APIs, "APIs, don't make your suck", and others.

Also, a nice rant on Agile development as we've recently come to an Agile crossroads on one of our projects and wanted to talk a little about it.

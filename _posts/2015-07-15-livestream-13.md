We ran a little over for this week's 540-15. Today we talked about a recent Adobe Flash vulnerability and Mozilla's reaction to this security issue... How to resolve conflicts in an Agile team (and in general as well)... and information around City Government Data.

Follow us on Twitter (@540co) and tune in live every Wednesday at 7am on #Meerkat and #Periscope!
